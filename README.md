## My CSS Is Easy II

- Submit directory: `.`
- Submit files: `index.html - style.css`

### Description

Create an HTML page named `index.html` with a CSS style named `style.css`.

It is required to use `Bootstrap 4`, `Bootstrap 5`, or `TailWindCSS`. If you use any `float`, this exercise will be considered as failed.

Bootstrap has a very powerful `grid system`. Learn it and use it! Check out the [Bootstrap 4 grid system documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/).

Bootstrap also has a lot of built-in classes. Before adding your own, you should check if it is not already part of Bootstrap. For example, check the [Bootstrap 4 text utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/text/).

Your page does not need to be responsive.

Your assignment is to replicate the following scheme:

![CSS Is Easy II Grid](https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-web/css_is_easy_II_grid.png)

The empty container should not contain the word "empty". The `header` text should be in bold.

Use the appropriate heading tags (`H1`, `H2`, `H3`).

The overall structure is sufficient for this project, as it is intended to be completed within 2-4 hours.

Tips:
- Google: Bootstrap 4 (or Bootstrap 5)
- Google: CSS tutorial
